# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning 

## Introduction
In today's digital age, AI and advanced technologies have a significant impact on detecting fake news, which has become a major challenge due to the rapid spread of information through social media and other platforms. Ensuring the authenticity of news is crucial for maintaining transparency and protecting the community. This study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, particularly a Deep Neural Network (DNN), to analyze news and classify it as fake or authentic. DNNs help automatically extract features from text data, reducing the need for extensive manual processing compared to traditional methods.

## Problem Definition
In today's digital age, the rapid development of information technology and social media has led to a massive amount of information being shared daily. However, the spread of fake news on these platforms has caused serious societal issues, such as distorting perceptions, influencing personal and community decisions, and even harming moral and political values. Detecting and addressing fake news has become an urgent task, requiring quick, accurate, and effective methods to protect the community from misinformation.

Previously, fake news detection was done manually by checking sources, cross-referencing with reliable information, or verifying authenticity through in-depth studies. However, due to the increasing volume of online information, these manual methods are no longer effective. They are time-consuming, prone to errors, and often fail to keep up with the vast amount of data that needs to be processed.

Currently, Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully applied in various fields, including statistics, business, finance, healthcare, and sociology, to detect fake news. Deep Learning models and modern semantic analysis algorithms can identify complex textual features, such as writing style, word choice, and contextual elements, to distinguish between real and fake information. The application of Machine Learning in detecting fake news promises to offer promising results in protecting communities from the negative impacts of misinformation.
